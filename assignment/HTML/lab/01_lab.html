    <p>A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications.

        The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end
        refers to how it works.

        You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.

        The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
